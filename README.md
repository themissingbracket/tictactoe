##### Description
---

This project is inspired on React [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

The idea is to build a similar react application using typescript and the new React Hooks. I Haven't had a look at the code which can be found [here](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010).


#### Future Plans 
---
-  Deploy to Heroku.
- CI/CD (Probably overkill for an app like this). But would help in getting an understanding of how CI/CD works.
